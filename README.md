# Netflix UI Clone

Single Page Application cloning Netflix's UI, with couple changes.

## Technologies:

- React
- React Router
- Styled-Components
- Material UI
- React-Hook-Form
- Yup
- TMDb (The Movie Database) API

## Installation

To run locally on development mode, you'll need Node.js installed. Then simply clone this repo and:

```

**Project currently under development**

## Todo:

- Integrate validation with Yup when I need schema validation
- Add GlobalStyles variables instead of magic colors and numbers
- Move background gradient layers to globalstyles
- Turn register page as Home and then redirect to the movies after fake login, for now
- "Search movies" functionality
- Refactor to Typescript

**Keep coding!**
